## ✊📃✂️ Rock Paper Scissors Game (JavaScript)

### 📖 What is this Project?

This project is a **web-based Rock Paper Scissors game** built using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**. It allows the user to play against the computer, where the computer’s move is generated randomly. The game instantly displays the **result (Win, Lose, or Tie)** along with both moves.

The project focuses on **core JavaScript logic and DOM manipulation**, making it ideal for beginners who want to understand how real games work in the browser.
